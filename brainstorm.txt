Brainstorming:
Tale
-a gargantuan carapace has been unearthed by delving critters, and something has awakened
-the various counting creatures that the mooty wort meets, after the fashion of the moudiewort in Deep Down Underground, are cute but subtley tainted and changed by cosmic horror-y vibes
-all the creatures of the underdark feel compelled to travel towards a siren song set of gentle vibrations through the ground called The Rapturous Rumble, which began shortly after the carapace was discovered
-the player ultimately has the option to accept The Rapturous Rumble and inherit the dead god's power, becoming the mighty moleskarn
    --final choice on this path would be: 
        ---use said power to banish The Rapturous Rumble and the dead god from the world, which mooty senses will also remove the power from him and make him a normal mole again
        ---embrace the darkness, embarking on a rampage and takes back the yard from The Humans... all the yards.   

Layout
-3 layers
    --basement1
        ---not-so fuzzy caterpillar (tickle fuzz)
        ---bulbous spider
        ---ochre ooze
    --basement2
        ---nakedest mole rat 
        ---grumpy grue (odditine obol)
    --basement3
        ---The Encounter.  Carapace is here, epicenter of Rapturous Rumble
-can move back and forth between layers as hubs, and then between the leaf tunnels from those hubs

Puzzles
-Inventory Object
    1. Tickle Fuzz: The fuzzy caterpillar sheds fuzz that can be used to tickle the nakedest mole rat, which will dislodge him from the tunnel he's standing over while paralyzed by rapture.  This grants access to the tunnel leading to the grumpy grue.
    2. Odditine Obol: The grumpy grue recognizes the stalwart determination in the mole and decides to gift him with a coin from a lost civilization that can serve as a focus that will help ward off the allure of the Rapturous Rumble; this allows the mole to reduce the sanity damage from The Encounter by 25%.
    3. Wiggly Gray Jar: the bulbous spider is fiddling with a strange gray jar that wiggles of its own accord.  He's having trouble righting himself after an overly energetic attempt to open the jar set him rolling back and forth over the tunnel floor's curvature.  He won't move perpetually because that's physically impossible, but he will roll long after his lifespan expires, so... the mole can help him, and in exchange the tired corpulent arachnid hands over the jar to be rid of it.
    4. Acid Claws: the ochre ooze will trade a set of acid claw sheathes to help the mole defend himself for the gray jar, which holds the ooze's mother.  It promptly eats the mother if provided.  These will reduce the sanity damage from The Encounter by 10%.
