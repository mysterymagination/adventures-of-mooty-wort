Brainstorming:
Tale
-inspired by and loosely follows the count from Deep Down Underground
    1. wee moudiewort digging
    2. pink earthworms wriggle wrangle
    3. big black beetles scurry scamper
    4. furry caterpillars scooch and scrunch
    5. fat spiders dance prance
    6. cold toads burrow scrape
    7. gray mice patter chatter
    8. green garter snakes slide glide
    9. armored snow bugs run and roll
    10. red ants march stamp
    ...all stop when they hear moudiewort sneeze.  I'ma go off rails almost immediately since I don't particularly want to write interactions for all 10 things for this demo.  Plus the counting thing falls away pretty quickly in the face of eldritch horror.  It'd be better to take inspiration from the pictures in the book of all sorts of neat weirdo stuff underground, like that awesome pointed crimson bone wand with a fused serpent wrapped 'round it.
-a gargantuan carapace has been unearthed by delving critters, and something has awakened
-the various counting creatures that the mooty wort meets, after the fashion of the moudiewort in Deep Down Underground, are cute but subtley tainted and changed by cosmic horror-y vibes
-all the creatures of the underdark feel compelled to travel towards a siren song set of gentle vibrations through the ground called The Rapturous Rumble, which began shortly after the carapace was discovered
-the player ultimately has the option to accept The Rapturous Rumble and inherit the dead god's power, becoming the mighty moleskarn
    --final choice on this path would be: 
        ---use said power to banish The Rapturous Rumble and the dead god from the world, which mooty senses will also remove the power from him and make him a normal mole again
        ---embrace the darkness, embarking on a rampage and takes back the yard from The Humans... all the yards.   

UI
-Undum tutorial layout fundamentally
-add inventory panel below character qualities
    --clicking item in inventory should activate a custom handler for that item that will check the next item/word clicked?
        ---realistically, the way to do something like that within what Undum and HTML give you more or less out of the box would be to make key subject words in content text Undum action links whose action function checks for a global pending item handler flag, which will be associated with the item handler function for the last item clicked.  Said item handler would check the subject word and if it has a thing to do for that subject will do it, else will print a default 'cannot use X on Y' type message.

Layout
-3 layers
    --basement1
        ---not-so fuzzy caterpillar (out: tickle fuzz)
        ---bulbous spider (out: wiggly Rusty Urn)
        ---ochre ooze (in: Rusty Urn -> out: acid claws)
    --basement2
        ---nakedest mole rat (in: tickle fuzz -> out: grants access to grumpy grue)
        ---grumpy grue (in: 3 conversation choices indicating Deepness -> out: odditine obol)
    --basement3
        ---The Encounter.  God's Carapace is here, epicenter of the Rapturous Rumble.  If mole gets here with enough sanity to keep his head before its majesty, he can choose to either adopt the power and exact revenge on humans who deny their yards to diggers or fight with every fiber of his being against the rotting remnants of divinity.  Else, he is enthralled like all the rest and it uses him as it sees fit; basically this will be the apocalypse, mole-style. 
            ----Combat: try to come up with a good combat system in Undum -- maybe the UI could be a relatively simple HTML table like we did with Twine but good and some nice little open animal art plus GIMP image effects and terrible drawing for images, channeling the howling tortured spirit of the unicorn games.
-can move back and forth between layers as hubs, and then between the leaf tunnels from those hubs

Puzzles
-Inventory Object
    1. Tickle Fuzz: The fuzzy caterpillar sheds fuzz that can be used to tickle the nakedest mole rat, which will dislodge him from the tunnel he's standing over while paralyzed by rapture.  This grants access to the tunnel leading to the grumpy grue.
    2. Odditine Obol: The grumpy grue recognizes the stalwart determination in the mole and decides to gift him with a coin from a lost civilization that can serve as a focus that will help ward off the allure of the Rapturous Rumble; this allows the mole to reduce the sanity damage from The Encounter by 25%.
    3. Wiggly Rusty Urn: the bulbous spider is fiddling with a strange gray jar that wiggles of its own accord.  He's having trouble righting himself after an overly energetic attempt to open the jar set him rolling back and forth over the tunnel floor's curvature.  He won't move perpetually because that's physically impossible, but he will roll long after his lifespan expires, so... the mole can help him, and in exchange the tired corpulent arachnid hands over the jar to be rid of it.
    4. Acid Claws: the ochre ooze will trade a set of acid claw sheathes to help the mole defend himself for the gray jar, which holds the ooze's daughter.  It promptly eats the daughter if provided.  These will reduce the sanity damage from The Encounter by 10%, but it costs 10% health to interact with the ooze.
-System Build/Hack/Use
    1. Elevator shaft through stone between basement2 and basement3 is borken and the mole needs to repair it to travel deeper; the strata is too hard for his claws.
        ->the heavy stone that lifts the elevator has snapped off its tether.  The mole must find a way to reconnect the tether himself or get a smaller creature to travel down the tether tunnel to do it for him.
        ->once the tether is reconnected, the mole must pull on his end of the tether and bring it all the way to the basement1 hook.
-Sliding puzzle world at basement3?  Maze of all that is?  Basically have to assert your presence into various physically confused sections of cave and magma that move out of your way into the one space that is void.
