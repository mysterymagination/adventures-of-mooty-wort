Brainstorming:
-a gargantuan carapace has been unearthed by delving critters, and something has awakened
-the various counting creatures that the mooty wort meets, after the fashion of the moudiewort in Deep Down Underground, are cute but subtley tainted and changed by cosmic horror-y vibes
-all the creatures of the underdark feel compelled to travel towards a siren song set of gentle vibrations through the ground called The Rapturous Rumble, which began shortly after the carapace was discovered
-the player ultimately has the option to accept The Rapturous Rumble and inherit the dead god's power, becoming the mighty moleskarn
    --final choice on this path would be: 
        ---use said power to banish The Rapturous Rumble and the dead god from the world, which mooty senses will also remove the power from him and make him a normal mole again
        ---embrace the darkness, embarking on a rampage and takes back the yard from The Humans... all the yards.
